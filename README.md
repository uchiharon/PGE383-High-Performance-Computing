# PGE383-High-Performance-Computing
This is a part of my graduate course at The University of Texas at Austin towards my PhD. As engineers, we are always faced with complex problems that would required voluminous computing and this course aims at teaching relevant skills for developing optimized code to result the computational demand of our solution.
